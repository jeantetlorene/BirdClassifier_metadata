# Empowering Deep Learning Acoustic Classifiers with Human-like Ability to Utilize Contextual Information for Wildlife Monitoring

Just as a human would use contextual information to identify species calls from acoustic recordings, one unexplored way to improve deep learning classifier in bioacoustics is to provide the algorithm with contextual meta-data, such as time and location. In this study, we exlpored different methods to provide location information to a bird song classifier.
